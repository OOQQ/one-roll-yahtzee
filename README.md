# yahtzee.js

Inspired by this Numerophile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTwar7mFws I created this script that removes all the tedious work and leaves you with just the data.

A week after completion, I realized I could archieve the same thing comparing two random numbers:
- If there's a 1 in 1296 to get a one roll yahtzee, then a one roll yahtze is equal to get a lucky number in 1296.

Which eliminates all the logic required to manage, count, store and sort and everything of 5 1 in 6 random numbers.

The line count went down from 106 to 6 (94.3% smaller). That's what you'll find in compressed.js
