# yahtzee.js

Inspired by this Numerophile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTwar7mFws I created this script that removes all the tedious work and leaves you with just the data.

A week after completion, I realized I could archieve the same thing comparing two random numbers. The line count went down from 106 to 6 (94.3% smaller). That's what you'll find in compressed.js
